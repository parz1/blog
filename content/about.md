# Why 为什么？

由于常常遇到瓶颈，于是我建立了博客。

> 用一句话来说明我对生活的态度，就是“无尽而廉价地热爱一切”。解释起来无非就是凡事都是三分钟热度，但量变终会发生质变，对知识广度的拓展往往能让我有方向上的正确性，也让我坚信自己能在这迫切需要与时俱进的时代舞台发光发亮。

## 关于 Nuxt3

想过非常多的技术方案，也尝试过基于 headless CMS 的 Jamstack 方案，但往往精力不够，所以需要一种低成本维护又不是探索性的方案，于是我选择了 Nuxt3，

I established a blog due to frequently encountering bottlenecks in life. To summarize my attitude towards life in one sentence, it would be 'to love everything endlessly and cheaply.' Explaining further, everything tends to be short-lived, but gradual progress can eventually lead to transformation. Expanding my knowledge breadth often provides me with direction and confidence to shine in this ever-evolving era.

Regarding Nuxt3, I considered numerous technical solutions and tried the Jamstack approach based on headless CMS. However, my energy was often insufficient, so I needed a low-cost and non-exploratory solution, which led me to choose Nuxt3.
